Scenario: It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. You’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

1. Data Engineering:

2. Data Analysis:
	a)  Schema.sql
I set up my schemas by looking at format of the CV files. This allowed me to upload those CVS on PG ADMIN in order to run my queries. 
	b)  Analysis.sql
  Once all tables were uploaded, I ran basic SQL queries on PG ADMIN to perform the suggested analyses. Then, I downloaded the tables that resulted from those analyses.
